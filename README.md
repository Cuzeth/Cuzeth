### Hey! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Cuzeth, a 16 year old developer looking to major in Computer Science. I have a passion for technology, programming, and self teaching. I am actively expanding my expertise with these coding languages and frameworks with the projects I continue to pursue: JavaScript/TypeScript, MongoDB, React, Swift/SwiftUI, and C++.
